### * Machine Learning : 
Machine learning is an application of AI which provides the ability to system to learn things without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning works on data and it will learn through some data. Machine learning is very different from the traditional approach. In, Machine learning we fed the data, and the machine generates the algorithm. Machine learning has three types of learning.<br>

1)Supervised learning. <br>
2)Unsupervised learning.<br>
3)Reinforcement learning.<br>
4)Semisupervised learning.

Supervised learning : means we trained our model with labeled examples so the machine first learns from those examples and then performs the task on unseen data. In this fake news detection project, we are using Supervised learning.
